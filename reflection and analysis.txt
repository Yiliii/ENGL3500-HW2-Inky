Janet Murray’s and Niesz & Holland’s discussions on interactive fiction highlight the transformation of storytelling from linear narratives to interactive, immersive experiences. Murray’s examination of digital environments highlights how procedural, participatory, spatial, and encyclopedic properties allow users to engage with the narrative in ways that traditional forms do not. Her analysis of ELIZA, for example, underscores how even simple interactive systems can create the illusion of meaningful dialogue. Niesz & Holland frame interactive fiction as a hybrid literary form, bridging fluidity with the structured constraints of written text. They argue that the reader in interactive fiction is not merely a consumer but an active participant in shaping the narrative.
Working with Inky reinforced these theoretical insights. By translating and rewriting ELIZA’s structured but flexible dialogue into branching choices, I saw firsthand how interactive storytelling requires both careful design and an understanding of user expectations. Every choice must be meaningful or at least appear to be, so that players feel agency in their decisions. Writing in Ink has showed me the challenge to find this fine balance between open-ended interactivity and authorial control, which is ensuring that the narrative remains engaging while maintaining coherence across different branches.  
The Inky experience also mirrors the MDA framework's directional flow. When I write the program as the designer, I begin by defining mechanics such as structured choices and diverts. After that, I think about how they shape the system's dynamics, determining how player inputs influence the progression of the story and then how this process ultimately leads to the player's aesthetic experience. In contrast, when I play the scripts myself or when I play other games like meanwhile, I can feel myself perceive the game in reverse. 
Interactive fiction redefines storytelling by prioritizing engagement over static progression. Unlike traditional literature, where the author dictates the experience, interactive fiction grants the user interpretive and narrative power, making the act of reading an exploratory and iterative process. This exercise showed that while interactive fiction can never be entirely open-ended, it excels at immersing the reader in a world where their choices matter, even if only within a carefully constructed illusion of freedom.
